                <p> Food is the basic need for humans to stay alive. According to Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, a
                    motivational psychological theory, Food is an innate physiological need along with water, warmth,
                    and rest. This tells the importance of Food in everyone’s lives. Food is the need of every living
                    organism. Therefore, we mustn’t waste Food.</p>

                    “You are what you eat”, or so they say. In today’s supermarkets, organic foods are everywhere. Not
                    only are there organic fruits and vegetables, but there are also organic dairy products, organic
                    meats, organic convenience foods, organic wine, beer, coffee, tea and even clothes made with organic
                    cotton. All of these choices have made organic foods the “fastest-growing segment of the grocery
                    industry.”
